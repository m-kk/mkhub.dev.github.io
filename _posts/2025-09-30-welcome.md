# Ship Better Designs Faster

Welcome to mkhub.dev! This is where you'll find premium templates and design systems built for professionals who need quality design work without starting from scratch.

## What I Create

I specialize in three core areas where design templates can have maximum impact:

### üè• **Healthcare-Focused Design**
**For medical professionals building their brand and career materials:**

- **Resume & CV Templates** - ATS-friendly designs for nurses, residents, PAs, NPs, and physicians
- **Clinical Notion Systems** - Rotation planners, procedure logs, CME trackers, study schedules
- **Portfolio Kits** - Case logs, cover letters, professional documentation templates
- **Telehealth UI Kits** - Dashboard components and patient-facing interface designs

*Why healthcare?* Medical professionals need materials that balance compliance, professionalism, and personality, which is hard to find in generic template marketplaces.

### ‚òï **Coffee & Hospitality Brands**
**For roasters, caf√©s, and hospitality businesses:**

- **Brand Identity Kits** - Complete brand guidelines, logos, color systems
- **Menu Boards & Pricing** - Print-ready and digital menu templates
- **Social Media Templates** - Instagram posts, stories, and promotional graphics
- **Packaging & Labels** - Coffee bag designs, stickers, branded materials

*Why coffee?* Small batch roasters and independent caf√©s deserve brand quality that matches their product quality‚Äîwithout agency prices.

### üíª **Developer-Ready Components**
**For product teams and indie developers:**

- **Figma Component Libraries** - Production-ready UI systems with variants
- **SwiftUI Code Snippets** - Reusable views and modifiers
- **Design Tokens** - Color, typography, spacing systems that translate to code
- **Icon Sets** - Consistent, scalable icons for apps and web projects

*Why developer-focused?* Bridging design and code means less back-and-forth, faster shipping, and better consistency.

## Why These Niches?

**Healthcare:** As a physician, I understand the unique needs of medical professionals‚Äîhaving worked in healthcare technology, I know what hiring managers look for and what clinicians actually use.

**Coffee:** As a coffee enthusiast and an owner of a coffee roastery (see: [Doctopus Coffee](https://doctopuscoffee.com)), I design for the craft and passion that goes into specialty coffee.

**Development:** I build apps and tools, so every design component I create is tested in real production environments.

‚úì **Update-friendly** - Built to accommodate your content without breaking
