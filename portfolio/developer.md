## Developer Resources & UI Kits

Production-ready design systems and components for developers who want to ship quality UI without starting from scratch.

---

### Built by a Developer, for Developers

I build apps. I know the pain of translating design to code, maintaining consistency, and iterating quickly. These resources bridge the gap between design tools and production code.

**Who these are for:**
- iOS/macOS indie developers shipping solo
- Small product teams without dedicated design resources
- Developers prototyping MVPs and side projects
- Teams wanting design-to-code consistency

---

## Figma UI Kits {#figma}

## Custom Development & Design

Need something specific for your app or product?

### What I Build:
- **SwiftUI app development** (macOS menu bar apps, iOS utilities)
- **Custom UI component libraries** (tailored to your design system)
- **Figma-to-code translation** (your designs, production-ready code)
- **Design system creation** (from concept to implementation)

### Typical Projects:
- Menu bar apps (productivity, system tools)
- iOS app MVPs (side projects, validation)
- Component libraries (reusable across your products)
- Design-to-code consulting (bridging design and engineering)

### Investment:
- **SwiftUI component library:** Starting at $1,500
- **Menu bar app MVP:** Starting at $2,500
- **Complete design system:** Starting at $3,000
- **Hourly consulting:** $150/hour (4-hour minimum)

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks typical for component libraries, 4-6 weeks for full apps

## Philosophy

**Design systems should:**
- Be easy to maintain (not overcomplicated)
- Translate directly to code (no lost-in-translation)
- Work in production (not just mockups)
- Respect platform conventions (feel native)

**Code should:**
- Be readable (clear names, good structure)
- Be reusable (DRY without over-abstraction)
- Be documented (comments where helpful)
- Be tested (in real apps, not just tutorials)

Everything here is built with these principles and used in actual shipped products.
